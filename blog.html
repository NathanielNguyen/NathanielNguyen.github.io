        <p class="blog">
        I live each day with increasing anxiety. I wonder how many people live 
        each day feeling the same as I do now. I use to look down on people who
        talk about how they feel like they do not feel worthy or that they feel
        inadequate. This is most likely because I have not been able to relate 
        to this feeling. That is, until right now. <br />
        Lately, I have been feeling like overwhelmed by everything that is going 
        on at school. Its not like the classes are beyond by ability, but it
        feels like its really easy for me get lost and fall behind. <br /> 
        I feel like I don't undestand the system very well and because of that
        it is causing me to have a great deal of anxiety because of lack of
        planning and organization. <br />
        My poor organization and planning has caused what feels like huge set
        backs to my mental state. For instance, my financial aid did not go
        through and I got the message about 2 months ago. I need to provide them
        with proof of offcampus housig. I have all the neccessary documentation
        but it not being officially approved is giving me a lot of anxiety. 
        What if I do get it passed, but there is no money and instead I am
        forked with a 4K bill.
